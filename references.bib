  abstract = {The Gravity field and steady state Ocean Circulation Explorer ({GOCE)}
	is the European Space Agency's mission that combines {GPS} tracking
	and gravity gradiometry to determine the Earth's mean gravity field
	with unprecedented, global accuracy with a spatial resolution down
	to 80‚Äâkm. This resolution makes {GOCE} gravity gradient data in
	particular useful for lithospheric scale modeling. However, the relation
	between coordinates in a model frame and at satellite altitude is
	not straightforward, and most geophysical modeling programs require
	a planar approximation, which may not be appropriate for satellite
	data. We derive the exact relation between the model reference frame,
	in which gradients from lithospheric modeling are given, and the
	local north-oriented frame in which {GOCE} gradients at 255‚Äâkm
	altitude are given. We generated gradients from a {GOCE} gravity
	field model and assessed whether the orientation differences between
	local north-oriented frame and model reference frame are relevant.
	In addition, we assessed the same for airborne gradiometry at an
	altitude of 5‚Äâkm because these data are complementary to {GOCE.}
	We find that if the regional area has a longitude extension of 5¬∞,
	the errors stay below 10\%. For larger areas the standard deviation
	of the systematic errors may be 40\% of the signal standard deviation.
	Comparing topographic mass reduction in planar and spherical approximation,
	one sees significant long wavelength differences in terms of gravity
	gradients or gradient-tensor invariants. The maximum error is up
	to 1 E at satellite altitude compared with maximum signal amplitude
	of 3 E. Planar approximation is therefore not accurate enough for
	topographic mass reduction of {GOCE} gravity gradients.},

  journal = {International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation},
  abstract = {The Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer ({GOCE)}
	is the European Space Agency's ({ESA)} satellite gravity mission
	to determine the Earth's mean gravity field. {GOCE} delivers gravity
	gradients, a new type of satellite data. We study how these data
	can improve modeling of the Earth's lithosphere. We discuss the use
	of the original {GOCE} gravity gradients versus the use of gravity
	gradients in grids at satellite altitude or close the Earth's surface
	and conclude that grids are easier to handle than the original data
	because one does not have to deal with very different error characteristics
	of the different gradients, given in a rotating frame at varying
	heights. The downward continuation to the surface enhances signal
	and better reflects the near-surface geology. But this does not outweigh
	the amplification of noise and omission errors, which is why we recommend
	using the field at mean satellite altitude for lithospheric modeling.
	The North-East Atlantic region is ideal to analyze the additional
	value of {GOCE} gravity gradients because it is a well-studied region
	in terms of regional geophysics. We calculated the gradient sensitivity
	for crustal depth slices using a {3D} lithospheric model. This reveals
	that especially interfaces with large density contrasts have a distinct
	signal in the gravity gradients, but that they are quite insensitive
	to intra-crustal density sources, which can have quite a large effect
	on surface gravity data. We also show that the satellite gradients
	have a depth sensitivity well suited to study the upper mantle density
	structure, making them complementary to gravity and seismic tomography.
	In the underexplored Rub‚Äôal-Khali area the {GOCE} vertical gradient
	was used to invert for crustal thickness. The updated Moho model
	gives a good fit to four of the six gradients and independent depths
	from seismic stations. The Moho model was used to update the heat
	flow model and source rock maturity maps, which are generally consistent
	with known source rock maturity trends in the surrounding regions.
	{GOCE} gradients are therefore useful to map crustal thickness and
	deep regional structures for frontier areas. In combination with
	other data, heat flow can be modeled which is essential for basin
	maturity evaluation.},

	being of difficult access and concealed by the Sahara. The new global
	gravity models are of unprecedented precision and spatial resolution
	and offer a new possibility to reveal the structure of the lithosphere

	The gravity fields show differences between the lineament and the

	high-density rocks must be present, which relate to either magmatic
	or metamorphic rocks. This is very different to the lineaments of

  journal = {International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation},
  abstract = {The {GOCE} (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer)
	mission, launched on March 2009, included a new type of satellite
	instrument, an on-board three-axis gradiometer able to measure the
	Earth's gravity gradients at the satellite height (255 km). The potential
	of this new type of measurement and its derived products (i.e., global
	gravity field models), together with other land-based geophysical
	observables (Bouguer and geoid anomalies), to image sub-lithospheric
	thermal and compositional anomalies is evaluated in this study. We
	focus on the Atlantic-Mediterranean Transition Region ({AMTR)}, the
	diffuse, transpressive contact between the Iberian Peninsula and
	North Africa. The present-day lithospheric structure in the area
	is characterized by a wide band of active deformation, large lateral
	variations in the lithosphere and the presence of a positive seismic-velocity
	anomaly in the uppermost mantle beneath the Betics and the westernmost
	Alboran Basin-Gibraltar Arc. Here, the perturbing effects of deep,
	sub-lithospheric density anomalies in {GOCE} gravity gradients and
	other land-based geophysical data are assessed, and its impact in
	lithospheric-scale geophysical-petrological modeling within a thermodynamically
	consistent framework analyzed. Some of the gravity gradients computed
	at the satellite altitude are rather sensitive to the presence of
	even a relatively small sub-lithospheric cold slab, like the one
	observed in the {AMTR}, showing the potential of the new {GOCE} data
	to map upper mantle anomalies. Lithospheric models ignoring the {AMTR}
	sub-lithospheric heterogeneities could be significantly biased. In
	particular, extreme changes of 4‚Äì6 km and 60‚Äì70 km in the crustal
	and lithospheric thickness, respectively, are required to include

  month = jul,
  abstract = {Various tasks in geodesy, geophysics, and related geosciences require
	precise information on the impact of mass distributions on gravity
	field-related quantities, such as the gravitational potential and
	its partial derivatives. Using forward modeling based on Newton‚Äôs
	integral, mass distributions are generally decomposed into regular
	elementary bodies. In classical approaches, prisms or point mass
	approximations are mostly utilized. Considering the effect of the
	sphericity of the Earth, alternative mass modeling methods based
	on tesseroid bodies (spherical prisms) should be taken into account,
	particularly in regional and global applications. Expressions for
	the gravitational field of a point mass are relatively simple when
	formulated in Cartesian coordinates. In the case of integrating over
	a tesseroid volume bounded by geocentric spherical coordinates, it
	will be shown that it is also beneficial to represent the integral
	kernel in terms of Cartesian coordinates. This considerably simplifies
	the determination of the tesseroid‚Äôs potential derivatives in comparison
	with previously published methodologies that make use of integral
	kernels expressed in spherical coordinates. Based on this idea, optimized
	formulas for the gravitational potential of a homogeneous tesseroid
	and its derivatives up to second-order are elaborated in this paper.
	These new formulas do not suffer from the polar singularity of the
	spherical coordinate system and can, therefore, be evaluated for
	any position on the globe. Since integrals over tesseroid volumes
	cannot be solved analytically, the numerical evaluation is achieved
	by means of expanding the integral kernel in a Taylor series with
	fourth-order error in the spatial coordinates of the integration
	point. As the structure of the Cartesian integral kernel is substantially
	simplified, Taylor coefficients can be represented in a compact and
	computationally attractive form. Thus, the use of the optimized tesseroid
	formulas particularly benefits from a significant decrease in computation
	time by about 45 \% compared to previously used algorithms. In order
	to show the computational efficiency and to validate the mathematical
	derivations, the new tesseroid formulas are applied to two realistic
	numerical experiments and are compared to previously published tesseroid
	methods and the conventional prism approach.},

  abstract = {The calculation of topographic (and iso- static) reductions is one
	of the most time-consuming operations in gravity field modelling.
	For this calculation, the topographic surface of the Earth is often
	divided with respect to geographical or map-grid lines, and the topographic
	heights are averaged over the respective grid elements. The bodies
	bounded by surfaces of constant (ellipsoidal) heights and geographical
	grid lines are denoted as tesseroids. Usually these ellipsoidal (or
	spherical) tesseroids are replaced by ‚Äúequivalent‚Äù vertical rectangular
	prisms of the same mass. This approximation is motivated by the fact
	that the volume integrals for the calculation of the potential and
	its derivatives can be exactly solved for rectangular prisms, but
	not for the tesseroids. In this paper, an approximate solution of
	the spherical tesseroid integrals is provided based on series expansions
	including third-order terms. By choosing the geometrical centre of
	the tesseroid as the Taylor expansion point, the number of non-vanishing
	series terms can be greatly reduced. The zero-order term is equivalent
	to the point-mass formula. Test computations show the high numerical
	efficiency of the tesseroid method versus the prism approach, both
	regarding computation time and accuracy. Since the approximation
	errors due to the truncation of the Taylor series decrease very quickly
	with increasing distance of the tesseroid from the computation point,
	only the elements in the direct vicinity of the computation point
	have to be separately evaluated, e.g. by the prism formulas. The
	results are also compared with the point-mass formula. Further potential
	refinements of the tesseroid approach, such as considering ellipsoidal
	tesseroids, are indicated.},

  abstract = {Four different forms of the tensor Green's function for the gravitational
	gradient tensor, derived in this article, give a theoretical basis
	for geophysical interpretations of the {GOCE-based} gravitational
	gradients in terms of the Earth's mass-density structure. The first
	form is an invariant expression of the tensor Green's function that
	can be used to evaluate numerically the gravitational gradients in
	different coordinate systems (e.g. Cartesian). The second form expresses
	the gravitational gradients in spherical coordinates (œë, œÜ) with
	the origin at the north pole as a series of tensor spherical harmonics.
	This form is convenient to apply when the {GOCE} data are represented
	in terms of the gravitational potential as a scalar spherical harmonic
	series, such as the {GOCO03S} satellite gravity model. The third
	form expresses gravitational gradients in spherical coordinates (œà,
	Œ±) with the pole at the computation point. The fourth form then
	expresses the corresponding isotropic kernels in a closed form. The
	last two forms are used to analyse the sensitivity of the gravitational
	gradients with respect to lateral distribution of the Earth's mass-density
	anomalies. They additionally provide a tool for evaluating the omission
	error of geophysically modelled gravitational gradients and its amplification
	when the bandwidth-limited {GOCE-based} gravitational gradients are
	interpreted at different heights above the Earth's surface. We show
	that the omission error of the bandwidth-limited mass-density Green's
	functions for gradiometric data at the {GOCE} satellite's altitude
	does not exceed 1 per cent in amplitude when compared to the full-spectrum
	Green's functions. However, when evaluating the bandwidth-limited
	Green's functions at lower altitudes, their omission errors are significantly
	amplified. In this case, we show that the short-wavelength content
	of the forward-modelled gravitational gradients generated by an a
	priori density structure of the Earth must be filtered out such that
	the omission error of the {GOCE-based} gravitational gradients (i.e.
	the signal that has not been modelled from the {GOCE} data) is equal
	to the omission error of the forward-modelled gravitational gradients.
	Only after performing such filtering can the {GOCE-based} gravitational
	gradients at low altitudes be interpreted in terms of the Earth's
	density structure. Both the closed and spherical-harmonic forms of
	the Green's functions allow a direct interpretation in terms of the
	minimum lateral extent of the Earth that needs to be considered in
	a regional model constrained by gravitational gradients if the full
	information provided by the Green's functions is to be retained.
	We show that this extent (i) is smallest for the vertical‚Äìvertical
	Green's function and (ii) linearly increases with increasing computation-point
	height. The spectral forms of the gravitational gradients are further
	used to calculate the sensitivity of the {GOCE-based} gravitational
	gradients to the depth of density anomalies, expressed in terms of
	the harmonic degree of the internal mass-density anomaly. We show
	that the largest gravitational gradient response is obtained for
	shallow mass anomalies, and is further amplified as the harmonic
	degree increases.},

  abstract = {As a simple building block, the right rectangular parallelepiped (prism)
	has an important role mostly in local gravity field modelling studies
	when the so called flat-Earth approximation is sufficient. Its primary
	(methodological) advantage follows from the simplicity of the rigorous
	and consistent analytical forms describing the different gravitation-related
	quantities. The analytical forms provide numerical values for these
	quantities which satisfy the functional connections existing between
	these quantities at the level of numerical precision applied. Closed
	expressions for the gravitational potential of the prism and its
	derivatives (up to the third order) are listed for easy reference.},
